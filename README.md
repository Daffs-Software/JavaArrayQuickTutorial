# JavaArrayQuickTutorial
Files for the short Array in Java tutorial as seen on youtube.

Compiling the files is as easy as naviagating to the directory you saved the files to, and running either:
'javac Example.java'
or
'javac Example2.java'

To run the files it is simply:
'java Example'
or
'java Example2'

If you are unsure how to do this, then refer to my tutorial on installing and using the Java Development Kit (JDK).
